I am a student in the 7th period of computer engineering at the Federal Technological University of ParanÃ¡ (UTFPR). I have experience in programming in SQL, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as advanced knowledge of English. I like to challenge myself to learn something new every day, being open to new challenges and looking for my first work experience in the programming area.
